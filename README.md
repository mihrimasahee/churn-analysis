# 📊 Churn Data Analysis

## 🔍 Overview
This project analyzes customer churn using a dataset containing customer behavior, demographics, and subscription details. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to churn and build predictive models.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Description**: Contains customer details, usage metrics, and churn labels.
- **Columns**:
  - `customer_id`: Unique identifier for customers
  - `tenure`: Number of months the customer has stayed
  - `monthly_charges`: Monthly billing amount
  - `total_charges`: Total amount paid
  - `churn`: (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained)
  

## 🔬 Analysis & Methodology
### **1️⃣ Data Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values, outliers, and data type conversions.
- Feature engineering for categorical variables.

### **2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Visualized churn distribution.
- Analyzed correlations between variables.
- Key insights from customer behavior.


## 📊 Results
- **Key Findings**:
  - High monthly charges correlate with higher churn.
  - Longer tenure customers are less likely to churn.

### At last using Logistic Regression model, evaluates it using a confusion matrix and accuracy score, and prints the results. It helps in understanding how well the model is classifying the given test data.
  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **GitHub** for version control
